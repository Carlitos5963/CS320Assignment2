Assignment 2:
prog2_1.cpp - This is a C++ file. This program takes exacty one CMD line arg that should be an integer. The program will then ask the user for input as many times as the CMD line arg stated. The user can quit whenever by typing "quit" or they can just keep entering input until the program terminates.
prog2_2.cpp - This is a C++ file. This class does what program 1 does but also uses the newly created Tokenizer.cpp class. The difference between program 1 and 2 is that the Tokenizer used in program 2 detects when input is correct and when it is wrong.
prog2_3.cpp - Program 3 takes in a single CMD line argument to determine how many inputs are taken in. The program takes valid input and prints error messages if input is invalid. This program also implements a stack and pushes and pops tokens depending on the values. Before the program quits, the contents of the stack are printed.
Tokenizer.cpp - This is a C++ class with no main function. This class is meant to be implemented. This class takes in 2 tokens and places them in a vector. The function returns a pointer pointing to the vector. 
Stack.cpp - This stack is a C++ class that can take in any data type. It has a constructor, Push, Pop, and Print methods. This class is used with program 3 to hold and organize the tokens pushed into it.
